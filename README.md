# Canadian-History-Quiz
The Canadian History Quiz is my personal learning project, designed to showcase my skills as a beginner in web development. This interactive web-based quiz serves as a testament to my journey in mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a project that I've built from the ground up to learn and apply essential web development concepts.
